Introduction:


This report encompasses the findings of the Principal Component Analysis(PCA) of the pop-music
landscape, using the ’popmusic.csv’ dataset.
In the dataset, there are 833 songs in total, from 17 different artists. The scope of this report is the
following ten numerical variables: (minor, chordnum, danceability, energy, loudness acousticness,
liveness, valence, tempo, duration sec), the detailed description of which can be found in the
appendix.


Since ten variables are too many to visualize insightfully, they will be summarized into four
new summary variables, with the aim of retaining as much variation as possible. The reduced
number of variables(i.e. dimensions) then enables easier interpretation of the variation in the
dataset.
